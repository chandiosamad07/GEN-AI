# üß† GEN AI with LangChain ‚Äì CampusX Inspired

This repository documents my learning journey of **Generative AI** with **LangChain**, following tutorials and guidance from [CampusX](https://www.youtube.com/c/CampusXOfficial). The project includes mini-apps, experiments, and use cases demonstrating how to build intelligent, LLM-powered systems using Python.
